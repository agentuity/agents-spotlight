# 🤖 Bun Codey Agent

This is a simple agent that can help you with understanding source code and answering questions about it and performing tasks related to it.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Bun**: Version 1.2.4 or higher

The `.env.example` file has examples of the environment variables you need to set in your local `.env` file. If you're importing this project into Agentuity, copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and then run `agentuity project import`.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Authentication

Before using Agentuity, you need to authenticate:

```bash
agentuity login
```

This command will open a browser window where you can log in to your Agentuity account.

### Creating a New Agent

To create a new agent in your project:

```bash
agentuity agent new
```

Follow the interactive prompts to configure your agent.

### Development Mode

Run your project in development mode with:

```bash
agentuity dev
```

This will start your project and open a new browser window connecting your Agent to the Agentuity Console in Live Mode, allowing you to test and debug your agent in real-time.

## 🌐 Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your agent to the Agentuity Cloud:

```bash
agentuity deploy
```

This command will bundle your agent and deploy it to the cloud, making it accessible via the Agentuity platform.
