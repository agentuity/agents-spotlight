# 🎓 OpenAI Tutor Agent

An intelligent tutoring system that demonstrates the OpenAI Agents framework with sophisticated multi-agent handoff patterns. This system routes educational questions to specialized subject matter experts for optimal learning experiences.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🤖 **Multi-Agent Architecture** - Coordinated system with specialized tutoring agents
- 🎯 **Smart Triage** - Automatically routes questions to appropriate subject experts
- 📚 **Specialized Tutors** - Dedicated agents for history and mathematics
- 🔄 **Agent Handoffs** - Seamless delegation between specialized agents
- 📖 **Educational Focus** - Explains reasoning and provides step-by-step solutions
- 🧠 **Context Preservation** - Maintains conversation context across handoffs
- 🚀 **Agentuity Native** - Built for seamless deployment on Agentuity platform

## 🏗️ Multi-Agent Architecture

### Triage Agent
The intelligent router that determines question types:
- **Question Analysis** - Analyzes incoming educational questions
- **Subject Classification** - Determines whether questions are about history or math
- **Agent Selection** - Routes to appropriate specialized tutor
- **Context Handoff** - Transfers relevant context to selected agent

### History Tutor Agent
Specialized in historical knowledge and analysis:
- **Historical Expertise** - Deep knowledge of historical events and contexts
- **Contextual Explanations** - Provides rich historical background
- **Critical Analysis** - Helps students understand cause and effect
- **Source Integration** - References historical sources and evidence

### Math Tutor Agent
Focused on mathematical problem-solving:
- **Step-by-Step Solutions** - Breaks down complex problems
- **Concept Explanation** - Explains underlying mathematical principles
- **Problem-Solving Strategies** - Teaches various solution approaches
- **Verification Methods** - Shows how to check answers

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies

- **TypeScript** - Primary development language with full type safety
- **OpenAI Agents** - Multi-agent orchestration framework
- **Zod Validation** - Runtime type validation and schema definition
- **Agentuity SDK** - Cloud-native agent platform integration

### Tutoring Workflow

1. **Question Reception** - Receives educational questions from students
2. **Intelligent Triage** - Analyzes question to determine subject area
3. **Agent Handoff** - Routes to appropriate specialized tutor agent
4. **Expert Response** - Specialized agent provides detailed explanation
5. **Context Maintenance** - Preserves conversation history and learning context

## 🚀 Quick Start with Agentuity

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher
- **Bun**: For package management (recommended)
- **Agentuity CLI**: Install from [agentuity.dev](https://agentuity.dev)

### Authentication

Before using Agentuity, you need to authenticate:

```bash
agentuity login
```

### Installation

Install dependencies using Bun:

```bash
bun install
```

### Development Mode

Run your project in development mode with:

```bash
agentuity dev
```

This will start your project and open a new browser window connecting your agent to the Agentuity Console in DevMode.

## 🌐 Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your agent to the Agentuity Cloud:

```bash
agentuity deploy
```
