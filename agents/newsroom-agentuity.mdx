- **Agentuity CLI**: Install from [agentuity.dev](https://agentuity.dev)

### Authentication

Before using Agentuity, you need to authenticate:

```bash
agentuity login
```

This command will open a browser window where you can log in to your Agentuity account.

### Development Mode

Run your project in development mode with:

```bash
agentuity dev
```

This will start your project and open a new browser window connecting your agents to the Agentuity Console in DevMode, allowing you to test and debug your multi-agent system in real-time.

### Configuration

Set up your environment variables for various integrations:

```bash
agentuity env set FIRECRAWL_API_KEY your_firecrawl_key
agentuity env set OPENAI_API_KEY your_openai_key
agentuity env set CLOUDFLARE_R2_ACCESS_KEY your_r2_key
agentuity env set CLOUDFLARE_R2_SECRET_KEY your_r2_secret
```

## 🌐 Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your agent system to the Agentuity Cloud:

```bash
agentuity deploy
```

This command will bundle your agents and deploy them to the cloud, making them accessible via the Agentuity platform.
