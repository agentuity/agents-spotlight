# üìß DMARC Email Report Processing Agent

Welcome to the DMARC Email Processing Agent! This project automatically processes DMARC reports received via email, analyzes them, and sends notifications to Slack. Built with the Agentuity platform for reliable, scalable email automation.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python**: Version 3.10 or higher
- **UV**: Version 0.5.25 or higher ([Documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/))

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Authentication

Before using Agentuity, you need to authenticate:

```bash
agentuity login
```

This command will open a browser window where you can log in to your Agentuity account.

### Development Mode

Run your project in development mode with:

```bash
agentuity dev
```

This will start your project and open a new browser window connecting your Agent to the Agentuity Console in Live Mode, allowing you to test and debug your agent in real-time.

You can also start your project in development mode without connecting to the Agentuity Console:

```bash
uv run --env-file .env server.py
```

## üîÑ Agent Flow Diagram

The DMARC Email Processing Agent follows a structured workflow starting from the `run()` method in `agents/dmarc_email/agent.py`:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Email Received]-->B[Extract Attachments];
    B-->C[Identify DMARC Files];
    C-->D[Parse XML Content];
    D-->E[Analyze Reports];
    E-->F[Summarize Results];
    F-->G[Send to Slack];
    G-->H[Return Summary];
```

### Input and Output

#### Input
- **DMARC Report Emails**: Emails sent to the agent's Email IO address
- **Attachment Types**: XML, ZIP, or GZ files containing DMARC reports
- **XML Content**: DMARC reports in XML format containing authentication results

#### Processing
1. **Email Reception**: Receive emails via Agentuity Email IO
2. **Attachment Processing**: Extract and decode attachment content
3. **Format Detection**: Identify DMARC files (XML, gzipped XML, ZIP)
4. **Content Extraction**: Parse and extract DMARC XML reports from attachments
5. **Analysis**: Process reports using OpenAI GPT-4o with specialized prompts
6. **Summarization**: Generate concise summaries of analysis results

#### Output
- **JSON Response**: Summary of DMARC analysis returned by the agent
- **Slack Notifications**: Analysis results sent to configured Slack channel

## üîß Configuration

Your project configuration is stored in `agentuity.yaml`. This file defines your agents, development settings, and deployment configuration.

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Usage

### Environment Variables

You can set environment variables for your project:

```bash
agentuity env set KEY=VALUE
```

### Secrets Management

For sensitive information, use secrets:

```bash
agentuity env set --secret KEY=VALUE
```

## üöÄ Production Deployment

To deploy this agent in a production environment (non-interactive, headless, or cloud):

### 1. Set Required Environment Variables
Set the following environment variables in your production environment `.env`

```
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=<your Slack bot token>
DMARC_CHANNEL_ID=<your Slack channel ID>
AGENTUITY_SDK_KEY=<your Agentuity SDK key>
ENVIRONMENT=production|development
```

### 2. Import Project
- If you don't already have a project created for this project, you can run `agentuity project import` in this repository to import this project to your Agentuity account. This will create a new Agentuity project, and automatically updates `agentuity.yaml` to point to your new project and agent_id

### 3. Deploy Your Code
- Ensure your environment variables are set
- Deploy your project to production with `agentuity deploy`

### 4. Set Up Email IO
- Visit your Agentuity dashboard and navigate to your DMARC project
- Go to the `Agents` tab and find your `dmarc_email` agent
- Add a new Email IO by clicking on the Email option
- Copy the generated email address (e.g., `agent_id@agentuity.run`)
- Configure your DMARC email routing to forward reports to this agentic email address
- Save the Email IO settings

### 5. Test Your Agent
- Send a test DMARC report email to the agentic email address
- Check your Slack channel for the analysis results
- Monitor the agent logs in the Agentuity dashboard for any issues
