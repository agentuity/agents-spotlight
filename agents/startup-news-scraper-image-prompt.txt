The image should display multiple news sources flowing into an AI processing center, with content being filtered, summarized, and distributed to various channels (email, Slack, Discord). Include elements like RSS feed icons, news articles, AI analysis workflows, scheduling clocks showing 7 AM, and communication platform logos. Use modern tech colors like orange, blue, and green to represent automation and news processing.
